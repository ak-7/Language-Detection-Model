Please run the Ipython Notebook file 
code/Baseline.ipynb
The folders model/, weights/, prob_eng/, prob_fr/, prob/ should be empty to run the code from scratch.

The directory consists of:

 code/  source_code Ipython Notebook and experiments and images included in the blog.
 	experiments/ contains source_code Ipython Notebook for each experiment conducted and corresponding results. It has been referenced in the blog.
 	model/ stores the model_json file for LSTM trained for each language
 	weights/	stores model weights for each LSTM
 	prob_eng/	stores probability of test string for English LSTM model
 	prob_fr/	stores probability of test string for French LSTM model
 	prob/		stores probability of test strings for all models together for Extra credits
 	subset/		stores all languages data for Extra credits
 	subset1/	stores modified English and French data only for baseline code
